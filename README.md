# Level 3 Task 3 -Designing and Building a Relational Database

## Task

Answer the following questions:

● Define a database and the three database language types covered in this lesson (8)

● Using the INVOICE table given below, draw its dependency diagram and identify all dependencies (including transitive and partial dependencies).

You can assume that the table does not contain any repeating groups and that an invoice number references more than one product.

Hint: This table uses a composite primary key

INV_NUM, PROD_NUM, SALE_DATE, PROD_LABEL, VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME, QUANT_SOLD, PROD_PRICE
211347, AX-P126VBB, 15-Jun-2018, Lawnmower, 111, Mowers and Bulbs, 1, R4099.90
211347, GF-5106D2F, 15-Jun-2018, Lightbulb, 111, Mowers and Bulbs, 8, R24,99
211347, RB-163698G, 15-Jun-2018, Blue paint, 063, All Things Paint, 1, R80,90
211348, AX-P126VBB, 15-Jun-2018, Lawnmower, 111, Mowers and Bulbs, 2, R4099.90

● Draw new dependency diagrams to show the data in 2NF.

● Draw new dependency diagrams to show the data in 3NF.

● Use this table to illustrate one of each kind of anomaly described in the task.

In a text file called anomalies.txt, how you would change the table and which anomaly that change would create.
