Q: Use this table to illustrate one of each kind of anomaly described in the task.
In a text file called anomalies.txt, how you would change the table and
which anomaly that change would create.

A: 
Update anomalies:
In the example, if the Vendor Name changes for example "Bulbs and ladders" no longer supply us, but "Game" does. To update all the information correct.
 
Insertion anomalies:
We can not update the "PROD_NUM, SALE_DATE, PROD_LABEL, VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME, QUANT_SOLD, PROD_PRICE" until we know the INV_NUM.

Deletion anomalies:
Example we can not delete this line:
211349	TF-7465023Q	17-Jun-2018	2m ladder 	207	Tall Things 	1 	R699,99

It would cause us to lose information about the Vendor and product name/price.
